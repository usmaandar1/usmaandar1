- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @usmaandar1
  
- ðŸ‘€ I am an enterprising Law LLM LPC postgraduate pursuing early career opportunities within the
technology sector; in particular, I am strongly inclined towards the intersection between technology,
and the public sector, as this provides a notable opportunity for enhancing public services and
addressing pressing societal challenges. Eager to leverage my legal background and years of
experience within the civil sector to navigate the complexities of the tech landscape, I am dedicated
to applying my distinctive skill set to propel advancements within this rapidly evolving industry. I
firmly believe that the technical skills I am acquiring through my participation in an extensive
Data Analyst bootcamp will prove exceptionally valuable in the realm of technology-related roles

- âš¡ Fun fact: Every male member of my family (on my dad's side) are serving or have served in the military.
